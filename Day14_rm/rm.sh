# üóëÔ∏è Demonstration of the Linux rm command

echo "\n‚ùó The 'rm' command is used to remove files and directories in Linux!"
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Be very careful with rm - deleted files cannot be easily recovered!"
echo "Let's see some practical examples with safety measures!\n"

# 1. Remove a single file
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove a single file:"
echo "   rm file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(This permanently deletes file.txt.)\n"

# 2. Remove with confirmation prompt
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove with confirmation (interactive):"
echo "   rm -i file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(This asks for confirmation before deleting - recommended for safety!)\n"

# 3. Remove multiple files
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Remove multiple files:"
echo "   rm file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(This removes all specified files.)\n"

# 4. Remove an empty directory
echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ Remove an empty directory:"
echo "   rmdir empty_directory/"
echo "   # OR"
echo "   rm -d empty_directory/"
echo "---"
echo "(Both commands remove an empty directory.)\n"

# 5. Remove a directory and its contents recursively
echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ Remove a directory recursively:"
echo "   rm -r directory/"
echo "---"
echo "(This removes the directory and everything inside it.)\n"

# 6. Remove recursively with confirmation
echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ Remove recursively with confirmation:"
echo "   rm -ri directory/"
echo "---"
echo "(This asks for confirmation for each file - safest for directories!)\n"

# 7. Force removal (be very careful!)
echo "7Ô∏è‚É£ Force removal (use with extreme caution):"
echo "   rm -f file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(This removes without confirmation, even write-protected files.)\n"

echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT SAFETY TIPS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Always double-check the path/filename before using rm"
echo "‚Ä¢ Use rm -i or rm -ri for safety (especially when learning)"
echo "‚Ä¢ Never use rm -rf / or rm -rf * in the root directory"
echo "‚Ä¢ Consider using trash-cli instead of rm for safer deletions"
echo "‚Ä¢ Make backups of important files before using rm\n"

echo "‚ú® Try these commands carefully on your Linux system! For more details, see the readme.md in this folder. Happy (and safe) removing! üóëÔ∏è"
