# üîÑ Demonstration of the Linux ps command

echo "\nüíª The 'ps' command shows information about active processes!"
echo "Let's explore how to monitor processes in Linux!\n"

# 1. Basic Usage
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ Show Current User's Processes:"
echo "   ps"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows basic process information for current user)\n"

# 2. Show All Processes
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ Show All Processes (BSD style):"
echo "   ps aux"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows detailed info about all processes)\n"

# 3. Show Process Tree
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ Display Process Tree:"
echo "   ps -ejH"
echo "   # OR"
echo "   ps axjf"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows process hierarchy in tree format)\n"

# 4. Show Process by User
echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ Show Processes for Specific User:"
echo "   ps -u username"
echo "---"
echo "(Lists all processes owned by username)\n"

# 5. Show Process by PID
echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ Show Specific Process:"
echo "   ps -fp 1234"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows detailed info for process ID 1234)\n"

# 6. Custom Format Output
echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Format Display:"
echo "   ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem --sort=-%cpu"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows PID, PPID, command, CPU%, and Memory%, sorted by CPU usage)\n"

# 7. Real-time Process Monitoring
echo "7Ô∏è‚É£ Watch Processes in Real-time:"
echo "   watch -n 1 'ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu,%mem --sort=-%cpu | head'"
echo "---"
echo "(Updates process info every second)\n"

echo "üìä COMMON FORMAT SPECIFIERS:"
echo "‚Ä¢ PID: Process ID"
echo "‚Ä¢ PPID: Parent Process ID"
echo "‚Ä¢ %CPU: CPU usage"
echo "‚Ä¢ %MEM: Memory usage"
echo "‚Ä¢ VSZ: Virtual memory size"
echo "‚Ä¢ RSS: Resident set size"
echo "‚Ä¢ TTY: Terminal type"
echo "‚Ä¢ STAT: Process status"
echo "‚Ä¢ START: Starting time"
echo "‚Ä¢ TIME: CPU time"
echo "‚Ä¢ COMMAND: Command name/line\n"

echo "üìù PROCESS STATES:"
echo "‚Ä¢ R: Running"
echo "‚Ä¢ S: Sleeping (interruptible)"
echo "‚Ä¢ D: Disk sleep (uninterruptible)"
echo "‚Ä¢ T: Stopped"
echo "‚Ä¢ Z: Zombie"
echo "‚Ä¢ X: Dead\n"

echo "üöÄ PRACTICAL EXAMPLES:"
echo "1. Find all python processes:"
echo "   ps aux | grep python"
echo ""
echo "2. Show top CPU consumers:"
echo "   ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%cpu --sort=-%cpu | head"
echo ""
echo "3. Monitor specific user's processes:"
echo "   ps -u username -o pid,ppid,cmd"
echo ""
echo "4. Check process tree for specific PID:"
echo "   ps -f --forest -p 1234"
echo ""
echo "5. Show threads of a process:"
echo "   ps -T -p 1234\n"
