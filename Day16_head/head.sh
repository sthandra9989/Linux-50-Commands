# üìÑ Demonstration of the Linux head command

echo "\nüìú The 'head' command is used to view the beginning of text files!"
echo "By default, it shows the first 10 lines of a file."
echo "Let's see some practical examples!\n"

# 1. View first 10 lines (default)
echo "1Ô∏è‚É£ View first 10 lines of a file (default):"
echo "   head file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows the first 10 lines of file.txt)\n"

# 2. View specific number of lines
echo "2Ô∏è‚É£ View specific number of lines:"
echo "   head -n 5 file.txt"
echo "   # OR shorter version"
echo "   head -5 file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows the first 5 lines of file.txt)\n"

# 3. View specific number of bytes
echo "3Ô∏è‚É£ View specific number of bytes:"
echo "   head -c 100 file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows the first 100 bytes of file.txt)\n"

# 4. View multiple files at once
echo "4Ô∏è‚É£ View multiple files:"
echo "   head file1.txt file2.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows the first 10 lines of each file with headers)\n"

# 5. View all but last N lines
echo "5Ô∏è‚É£ View all but last N lines:"
echo "   head -n -5 file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows all lines except the last 5 lines)\n"

# 6. Quiet mode (no headers)
echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ View multiple files without headers:"
echo "   head -q file1.txt file2.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Shows content without file headers)\n"

# 7. Verbose mode (always show headers)
echo "7Ô∏è‚É£ View with headers (verbose):"
echo "   head -v file.txt"
echo "---"
echo "(Always shows headers, even for single file)\n"

echo "‚ö° PRACTICAL USES:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Quick peek at log files"
echo "‚Ä¢ View file headers or metadata"
echo "‚Ä¢ Check file content without loading entire file"
echo "‚Ä¢ Monitor new entries in log files"
echo "‚Ä¢ Preview large text files\n"
